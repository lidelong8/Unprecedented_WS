# Unprecedented_WS
The codes to calculate unprecedented water scarcity (UWS): UIWS, UDWS, UFWS, and WS

We provide a virtual time series that exactly matches the length of our research data, which is monthly data from 1850 to 2100, with a length of 3012. The MATLAB files are placed in the same folder. Navigate to this folder and directly run each demo file. You can obtain the schematic diagram. The key parameters for obtaining this diagram are consistent with the main text.


The Repositories includes five files

(1)READMEs :   A description file of instructions for reproducing the key results (identify UWS: UIWS, UDWS, UFWS, and WS);

(2)cal_TFE_mon_demo.m :   The Core function to calculate UWS, which must be placed in current working directory;

(3)demo_plot_Fig.s1_4x1_method.m :  The demo code calculating the UIWS, UDWS, UFWS, and WS, please see Fig.s1;

(4)demo_plot_fig.sx_diagram_duration.m :  The demo code calculating the independent WS events, See Fig.sx.diagram_duration.jpg;

(5)demo_plot_fig.sx_diagram_frequency.m : The demo code calculating frequency of WS, please see Fig.sx.diagram_frequency;

(6) Fig.s1.jpg :  The Expected output.

(7) Fig.sx.diagram_duration.jpg :  he Expected output.

(8) Fig.sx.diagram_frequency.jpg :  The Expected output.

The use of these codes The package has been tested on the Windows systems with MATLAB software.The package has been tested on the following systems MATLAB Version 9.10.0.1602886 (R2021a) Operating System Microsoft Windows 10 Professional Version 10.0 (Build 19044)

Firstly unzip these files in your computer, then modify the working directory as your Unzip folder and Run. You are expected to obtain three images.
